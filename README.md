# Unbeatable AI Tic-Tac-Toe Game

Welcome to the Unbeatable AI Tic-Tac-Toe Game repository! This project features an advanced Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented in Python, with an AI opponent that leverages the Minimax algorithm to ensure unbeatable gameplay.

## Features

- **Unbeatable AI:** The AI uses the Minimax algorithm to always play the optimal move, making it impossible for the player to win.
- **Interactive Gameplay:** Play against the AI in a user-friendly command-line interface.
- **Clean and Modular Code:** The codebase is well-organized and modular, making it easy to understand and extend.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed comments and documentation to help you understand the inner workings of the game and the Minimax algorithm.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/unbeatable-tic-tac-toe.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd unbeatable-tic-tac-toe
   ```

### Running the Game

Simply run the following command to start the game:
```bash
python tic_tac_toe.py
```

Follow the on-screen instructions to play against the unbeatable AI.

## Minimax Algorithm

The Minimax algorithm is a recursive algorithm used in decision-making and game theory. It provides a systematic way to determine the best move for the AI by evaluating all possible game states and choosing the move that maximizes the AI's chances of winning while minimizing the player's chances.

### How It Works

1. **Recursive Evaluation:** The algorithm simulates all possible moves by both the AI and the player, recursively evaluating the game state after each move.
2. **Scoring:** Each game state is scored based on the outcome:
   - +1 for a win
   - -1 for a loss
   - 0 for a draw
3. **Optimal Move Selection:** The AI selects the move that leads to the game state with the highest score, ensuring the best possible outcome.
